# sinesaw #

Web audio DAW.  Requires Chrome >= 39.

`npm install` and then `gulp` to run a server and watch coffee/styl source
files.  `mocha` to run tests.

The idea behind sinesaw is to create an in browser DAW with an interface similar
to Ableton Live, but allowing concurrent collabarative editing by multiple
users.  In terms of latency and processing power, it is difficult for javascript
to complete with native DAWs, but running in browser makes collaboration and
sharing so easy that I think there is an interesting place for it.  I hope the
limited processing power will inspire creativity more than hold people back.

Sinesaw is far from complete - so far it includes a piano roll editor, a working
analog synthesizer, drum synthesizer, and sampler, and web midi input.


### architecture

Sinesaw plays audio through through a single scriptProcessor audio node running
in a worker thread - the audio output is a pure function of the song state and
the current time, this single function is called for every sample of audio.

This approach to audio was inspired by the excellent
[wavepot](http://wavepot.com) project.

Sinesaw uses React.js for the user interface, and a custom
[cursor](https://github.com/charlieschwabacher/cursor) library for immutable
data modeling.. Song state is kept in a single object passed from the ui to
the audio processing code.

The immutable data makes it easy to identify changes and keep state in sync
between multiple threads doing audio processing, multiple concurrent clients,
and a persistent document on the server.

For a more complete explanation of immutable data, check the readme for cursor.


### approaching the code

The best place to start looking at code for audio output is
`app/scripts/dsp/song.coffee`, and `app/scripts/ui/app.cjsx` is the entry
point for the UI code.

The index file for the main thread is `app/scripts/index.coffee` - this creates
both a `Song` model and the root react component `App`.

Planned work is in `todo.txt` and working notes are in `notes.txt`
